# Contributing to SecDevAI

Contributions to the project are always welcome. Please feel free to create pull requests, or report issues. 

**Note:** For guidance on adding new security context such as rules, tools, or languages, see the **"Extending SecDevAI"** section in [`docs/usage.md`](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/secdevai/blob/main/docs/usage.md#extending-secdevai).

We encourage you to contribute your context extensions back to help the community! AI-generated code is absolutely welcome, however, just make sure to test your changes and provide clear descriptions in your PR. Every contribution, big or small, helps make SecDevAI better.
