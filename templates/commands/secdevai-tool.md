/secdevai-tool all             # Run all available security tools
```

## What This Command Does
This is an alias for `/secdevai tool`. See the main `/secdevai` command documentation for full details.

When invoked, this command:

- Parses tool output and synthesizes with AI analysis
- Falls back to AI-only analysis if tool is unavailable
- Provides integrated findings combining tool results with AI insights

## Expected Response

When user runs `/secdevai-tool`:

1. **If no tool specified** (e.g., `/secdevai-tool` with no arguments):
   - **IMPORTANT**: Prompt the user to select which tool they want to use
   - Display available tools with descriptions in a clear, user-friendly format:
     - Show a heading: "SecDevAI Tool Selection"
     - List available tools with brief descriptions:
       - **bandit**: Python security linter - Scans Python code for common security issues
       - **scorecard**: Repository security assessment - Evaluates repository security practices (OSSF Scorecard)
       - **all**: Run all available security tools (bandit and scorecard) and combine their findings
     - Show usage examples:
       - `/secdevai-tool bandit` - Run Bandit for Python security analysis
       - `/secdevai-tool scorecard` - Run Scorecard for repository security assessment
       - `/secdevai-tool all` - Run all available security tools
   - Do NOT run any tool automatically - wait for user to specify which tool they want

2. **If tool specified** (e.g., `/secdevai-tool bandit`, `/secdevai-tool scorecard`, `/secdevai-tool all`):
   - Run the specified security tool(s) via `.secdevai/scripts/security-review.sh`
   - If `all` is specified: Run both bandit and scorecard, combining their findings
   - Parse tool output and synthesize with AI analysis
   - If tool unavailable: Fall back to AI-only analysis with a message explaining the tool wasn't found
   - Provide integrated findings combining tool results with AI insights
   - Present findings in a structured format similar to `/secdevai review`
   - When `all` is used, clearly indicate which findings came from which tool
   - **Save Results** (after tool execution):
     - Collect tool findings into structured format
     - Use `secdevai_cli.results_exporter.export_results()` to save results
     - Prompt user to confirm result directory (default: `secdevai-results`)
     - Save both markdown and SARIF files with timestamp: `secdevai-tool-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` and `.sarif`

## Available Tools
- `bandit`: Python security linter - Scans Python code for common security issues
- `scorecard`: Repository security assessment tool (OSSF Scorecard) - Evaluates repository security practices
- `all`: Run all available security tools (bandit and scorecard) and combine their findings
