## What This Command Does
This is an alias for `/secdevai fix`. See the main `/secdevai` command documentation for full details.

When invoked, this command:
- Shows suggested fixes with before/after code
- Explains security implications
- Previews changes before applying
- Requires explicit approval before modifying code

## Expected Response

**Important**: 
- Always shows preview before changes and requires explicit approval
- After applying fixes, always save results to Markdown and SARIF formats:

  - Prompt user to confirm result directory (default: `secdevai-results`)
  - Save both markdown and SARIF files with timestamp
